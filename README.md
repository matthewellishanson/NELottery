**Reporter's note:** *This story did not get published as a result of conflicts with the end of my internship and the beginning of my next job at a different publication. However, original reporting was done, drafts written and edited,  and as you will see from the data analysis below, there were and should still be newsworthy trends worth exploring in the Nebraska lottery.*
